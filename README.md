# Hospital Management System

## Project Description

This **Hospital Management System** is a relational database project designed to efficiently manage hospital data such as patients, doctors, appointments, diagnoses, medications, and billing. The system uses **database normalization principles** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to organize data into multiple related tables, minimizing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.
